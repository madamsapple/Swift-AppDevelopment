This is an app called "myMerch". Within the context of the music business, mMerych allows you to manage your merch catalogue, gain insight into business practices, see trends, and ultimately help one succeed in making the most out of
selling merch as artists, management/consultants, designers.

The general project area was termed as "merch by creatives".

You do not need any external libraries or downloads to run the project; simply download the "App" folder and run the xcode project.
To sign in to the app, enter username as "username" and password as "password".

I documented the development of the app [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vThHTOM-EdfqNIzvuQgxIgHen72jOdbeqGfJubdINaoCUMfgk--95Noqd-5xrdUQaDR2hX5zIFcdIXB/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g252993aaf1b_1_35).
